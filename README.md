# Skate Simulator

A gnarly game made using **Unity**. In this game you control a skateboard and can explore any trick imaginable! There are plenty of obstacles to grind/shred on, followed by a huge half pipe.

# How to Play

Unzip the **skate-sim.zip** file and run the executable. The main purpose/goal is to just enjoy cruising around while expressing your creativity via forming unique and elegant tricks. The game is made to play on keyboard only, with typically movement being **W/S** and turning being **A/D**. Below is a list of full controls.

### Controls

***Movement*** - WASD
***Ollie/Jump*** - O
***Spin Left/Kickflip*** - I
***Spin Right/Heelflip*** - P
***Manual** - SHIFT
***Nose Manual*** - CTRL
***Save Checkpoint*** - ENTER
***Load Checkpoint*** - BACK

# Final Remarks

Throughout building this skateboarding environment, I not only learned Unity but C# as well. It was fun learning about physics and testing my code in a hands on approach via playing. Some of the physics interactions that skateboarding has was hard to perfectly simulate in a game engine. Despite some challenges, the final result feels fun to play and mess around with. Below are some photos of the game:
